Google has launched a new tool that lets users search for new job listings across
many major career websites.
Beginning Tuesday, English-speaking job seekers in the United States will be able
to use the new service.
The new search tool was first announced at Google's yearly developer's conference
in May.
Now, when people search for jobs or jobs near me on Google, the results will include
listings from a number of websites.
In the past, Google job search only brought up general results from major job sites.
With the new results, users can connect directly to the job descriptions that interest
them.
Among the major job sites cooperating with Google are Linkedin, Monster, CareerBuilder, Facebook,
ZipRecruiter and Glassdoor.
The tool allows job seekers to narrow their search by category, job title or date posted.
The new search service can also let users know how long will take to drive to the new job.
As with many career websites, people can also request that alerts or emails be sent 
to inform them of new jobs of interest.
Google says the new system helps job seekers by putting many different listings in one
place.
Users no longer have to go onto multiple websites to search.
An announcement on the company's website said the system is powered by Google's Machine
Learning Technology.
This makes the results more revelant and provides suggestions to users of other
possible jobs of interest
The search is also supposed to prevent duplicate or old listings from coming up.
Google plans to keep adding new job sites to the system over time.
The company said it has encouraged all job providers to make openings available through new Google
Career Search.
The system is available for people using a desktop or mobile device.
The new service is Google's latest attempt to users on the search engine while they 
seek various products.
The company already expanded his search capabilities related to travel, ordering food 
and connecting users to other local services.
