Several months ago, I taught one of my colleagues how to play basketball.
As a physical sport, if you want to compete with others in playing basketball,
you should master some techniques to play well. I taught him some basic knowledge
about basketball game, such as how to shoot and how to keep his position, and some
useful techniques about defense and offence. 
I think when you teach someone else something, you're practicing it as well,
it's also a progress of practicing. And if you could describe important steps
in doing something, you may have mastered it perfectly.
