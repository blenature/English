Come to think of sceience lesson, I want to talk about biology.
We had about 2 biology courses everyday. I felt very free in
these courses because of my interest in learning biology.
Mr. Wang taught me biology, he's a very tall teacher and
not very strict. I liked learning biology not only because I think
it's easier to learn, but I really realized its importance for
understanding lives. I had learnt a lot of things about lives,
such as why you can fell hungry, what is happening in your stomach
after eating, where the energy that drives your body comes from,
and why you look like your father, rather than you mother, what
a child will inherit from his parents. Such things really appealed 
to me, and nothing could distract my attention from it.
