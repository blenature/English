I want to talk about one situation I experienced when I was a high scholl student.
On a Friday afternoon, we just finished our courses and were ready to go home
for our weekend. I had to take bus home and the traffic fee was about 3 yuan.
But I couldn't afford it at that time, maybe I was short of 2 yuan.
But I was so stupid that I even didn't borrow some from my friends.
I just went to the bus station, got on a bus and was waiting for it
to leave. Do you know what action I took, I just got off the bus because 
I thought I could afford the traffic fee. I called my father to pick me
up at the bus station. After I came back home, my father told me that
I should have taken that action because I could just take the bus home,
and paid the traffic fee after the bus arrived the destination. You could borrow
some money, or asked me to pick you up at the destination, and I paid the fee.
I really learned a lot from this lesson, I should be more experienced and think 
more careful and choose the best way.
