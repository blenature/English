Comes to think of an activity near water, I want to talk about a happy moment I shared
with my wife. My wife loves sea very much, so she always wants a trip to beach.
And at a weekend, in 2014, we travelled to Tianjin, a city adjacent to the sea.
The weather was so great that it's the best time to enjoy a holiday on the beach.
Actually, that's the first time I ever saw a sea. We walked on the beach, drew on the beach.
Travelling with my lover led to a memorable moment.
