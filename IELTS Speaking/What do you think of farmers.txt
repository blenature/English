I will never say anything bad about farmers, bacause I'm a framer when I was a child, my
parents are farmers, most of my relatives are farmers. I think they are kind of hardworking,
full of enthusiasm about their work, full of love to their land. I think we should always
remember the things they do for us, they create the food we eat, they feed livestocks that
we get meat from. Lastly, I think they are nice of people, they'll never hurt others, they 
never blame others.
