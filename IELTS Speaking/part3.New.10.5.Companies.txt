Should big companies be published more seriously if they break the law?
Yes, I would have to say yes. As the above arguement we have mentioned,
the one who are more competent takes more responsibility of the social 
concept of value. So big companies should act as the role model for the 
public. In most cases, we must emphasize the authority of law. If we do
not punish the campany which should have respected the law seriously, we may
deliver a dangerous message to the public that one could break the law to
earn the most profit or get the best interest. And the company which
is punished slightly may have worse behaviors in the future, because it
isn't afraid to be published, the fine may be even less that what it earned.
We must always convery a strong message to the public that nobody could break the
law regardless who they are.
