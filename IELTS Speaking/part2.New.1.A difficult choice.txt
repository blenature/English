Describe a difficult choice you made that turned to be right

I want to talk about the most important person in the rest of my life.
Three years ago, I just met the person who has become my life late.
We fell in love with each other, and two months after we first met with each other,
she was pergant. Many of my friends ever encounter this issue, and they finally
decided to abandon this kid. I know that's terrible, that's committing a crime.
I just didn't want to get my lover hurted, and the person who would be the most
important person in my life.
We made a significant decision, my wife left her job and go back home to protect
this kid, finally, we got a cute, lovely kid.
