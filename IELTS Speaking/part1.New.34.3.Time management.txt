What do you do to improve your time management?
I know that time managemeng skill is very important for one's caree success.
So I really made some effort to improve my time management skill.
As for me, I should first know I want to achieve, and then I should
know what I should to gain my goal, and then schedule a plan for
the goal. The plan maybe consists of some steps. I should clearly
know when I should start to take a certain step, and when I should finish
this step. If the plan go behind of the schedule, I must reschedule my plan.
