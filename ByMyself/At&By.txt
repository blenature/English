At followed by time and By followed by time

When we say, 'I can do it by 2 p.m', 'I can do it at 2 p.m'. They have different meaning.
'by 2 p.m' means something I'll do will be done before 2 p.m, it will not be later than
2 p.m.
'at 2 p.m' means something I'll do will be done at 2 p.m, not befor not after, just 2 p.m.
