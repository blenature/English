to possible interview questions as well as a few questions to ask.
Should I prepare what to wear?

and also whether you will fit in nicely with their corporate culture
A:You're right. Etiquette is fundamental.I'll get my outfit dry cleaned and have my hair trimmed
B:How about the documents for the interview.
A:I'll take a briefcase with copies of my resume, references, recommendation letters and pens
and paper.
B:It seems you're on the right track and almost ready to go. Oh, and make sure to be punctual.
I recommend you arrive 30 minutes early, because it's possible to get delayed while commuting.
A:I'll keep that in mind.
B:However, do not go to the company's office too early. Career experts have suggested that 
10 to 15 minutes before the interview is the ideal time to arrive. It'll give you time for 
some deep breaths to settle your nerves.
A:This's a great tips.Thank you Orlando.
