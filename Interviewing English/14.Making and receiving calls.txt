A:Hello, thank you for calling Pinto products. This is Brad speaking, how
may I assist you?
B:Good afternoon, Brad. My name is Andrea and I work for Innovative Incorporated.
I'm calling to speak with Zen about the details of a project we're colaborating on.
Is it convenient to speak to him at the moment?
A:I am not sure if he's available. Would you mind holding for a moment while 
I check.
B:That'll be fine. Thanks
A:Thank you. It'll only be a moment
Thirty seconds later.
A:Andrea, thanks for holding. Unfortunately, Zen isn't at his desk right now.
B:Are you able to tell me when he'll return?
A:I am sorry, but I'm not sure. He's been busy every morning this week, because
of the convention next week. Would you like to leave a message and I will ask him
to call you back as soon as he returns?
B:No, it's OK. I won't be in my office for a few hours. It's probably better if I
call him back later in the day. What time does he work till?
A:Five thrity.
B:Thanks
A:Is there anything else I can assist you with?
B:No, that's all, thank you
A:OK, have a pleasant day.
B:You too, bye
