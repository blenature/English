A:Cybercloud Service Department, Morris speaking.
B:Hi, Morris, this is Andrea from Innovative Inc.
A:Hi, Andrea, what can I do for you
B:I'm afraid there is a problem with the software we received this morning.
A:Oh, what seems to be the problem
B:Well, we ordered 24 copies of A-designer, but we actually received A-designer Lite
A:All 24 copies?
B:Yes, and we didn't realize until after our IT technician installed them
on all of our workstations.
A:Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you for bringing this problem to my attention.
I think the problem may have been caused by a lack of communication 
among our staff.
B:So how can this issue be resolved?
A:First of all, I'll personally see to it that the problem is solved promptly.
And rest assured knowing that resolving this issue has our company's highest priority.
B:Thank you, Morris, I appreciate that.
A:I will pack the correct software by myself and organize(arrange) for one of warehouse staff to
deliver it in our company's service vehicle.
B:Thank you. So I can expect the correct software to be delivered this afternoon?
A:Absolutely. I will also see to it that you will receive an additional 5 percent
discount on this order.
B:Thanks
A:No problem. It's the least we can do.
