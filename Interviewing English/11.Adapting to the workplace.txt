A:Andrea, the creative department is often very busy. Everyone is a team player.
There're tight deadlines that must be met, and we like everyone to
be productive at all times. Do you think you'll be able to hit the ground
running and adapt to the culture quickly.
B:Definitely. In fact, I'm excited by the prospect of working within such a team.
A:Can you give me an example of how you have previously adapted to a new
situation in the workplace?
B:Certainly. In my previous postion, drastic changes in the fasion world were common. 
On one occasion, an entire range of clothing that was ready for the market was
cancelled, and replaced with another range. My colleagues and I kept our noses to
the grindstone and redesigned and replaced the store displays over a single weekend.
A:You're happy to work overtime on short notice?
B:Absolutely. 
A:Now then. What would you do if you had a different opinion from your supervisor's?
B:I would discuss the matter in private and repect their decision if they donot 
agree with me.
A:Ummmm, how do you handle criticism?
B:As far as I'm concerned, constructively criticism is always welcome.
