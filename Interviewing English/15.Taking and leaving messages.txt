A:Good morning, Creativity Department, this is Andrea speaking.
How may I help you
B:Good morning, Andrea, My name is Ben, and I need to speak to
Oliver. I've been calling his extension, but I'm afraid he is not answering
his phone
A:Hi, Ben, I'm sorry you haven't been able to reach Oliver. May I ask
you to hold for a moment and I will see if he is at his desk?
B:Certainly
A:Thanks Ben
Thirty seconds later
A:Hello, Ben, are you still there?
B:Yes, I'm still here
A:I'm sorry, Ben. Oliver is in a meeting, and is not expected to return to his desk
until four o'clock. Would like me to take a message and I can get him to
call you back as soon as he returns?
B:That would be great. Could you tell him Ben Stephenson from City IT Services called.
A:So that was Ben ... 
B:
A:My apologise. Does Oliver have your number?
B:I'm sure that he has my direct line but I'll give you my cell phone number
as I'll probably be out of the office after four o'clock. 0909020202
