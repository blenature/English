A:I'm so excited about our trip to Florence. I've never been on an overseas business
trip before.
B:This will be my second trip. I'll be much better prepared this time.
A:Where did you go previously(last time).
B:I went to Vancouver
A:Oh, I would love to go to Canada. How was the flight
B:Emm, it was a long-range flight. I would have enjoyed it more if I had pre-booked a seat
with more legroom
A:That's a good tip. Do you have any other suggestions you can share
B:It's important to make sure your travel documents, including your passport and visa
are valid.
A:Oh, that's good advice.
B:And be sure to pack any containers with more than 100 ml of liquid into your check-in luggage.
instead of your carry-on luggage.
A:Does that include sunscreen
B:It sure does. It goes without saying that weapons such as knives and guns can't be
taken abroad; however, items that could be used as weapon, such as nail clippers or letter
openers will also be confiscated if you pack them into your carry-on luggage.
A:Really
B:Yes. And make sure that you know where your hotel is and how to get there. I recommend
taking a free shuttle bus if one is free.
(Can you give me some tips on how to deal with that problem)
