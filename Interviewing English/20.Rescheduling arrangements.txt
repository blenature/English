A:Good morning, Innovative Inc. Creativity Department, Andrea speaking
B:Hi, Andrea, this is Jacob from Zozo calling. How are you today
A:I am very well, thank you, and you?
B:I am fine. But I'm afraid that I have some bad news regarding the meeting
this afternoon, something has come up
A:Oh, really, what's the problem.(What seems to be the problem)
B:Our computer network has had a major breakdown this morning. We have lost all of
our files, including the files with all the sales data as well as the sales
projection's
A:Oh, no, do you have backups
B:Yes, but at the moment, we can't access(get into) the server where our backups are
A:Oh, that is bad news. I'm so sorry to hear that. I guess the meeting will have to
be rescheduled.
B:Yes, I'm afraid so. Our IT technicians have said they will need the rest of the day
to set everything back to normal. So we have to reschedule the meeting for late
this week.
A:That's OK, I understand.
B:I'm so sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.
A:Don't mention it, these things happen.
B:Thanks, I really appreciate your patience. I'll  call you later to reschedule
the meeting.
