A:What have you learned from your previous job as a display specialist.
B:As a display speclialist for teenage clothing, I accumulated a general 
understanding of young customers' tastes and spending habits. I also 
learned how to achieve goals while working in a small team.
A:How did you understand customers' tastes and spending habits
B:I have taken charge of a few clothing displays for teenagers'brands. From my
observation, young customers reacted relatively positively to outfits of various styles.
They are more open to mix-and-match and learn to dress attractively on a limited budget
A:You mentioned you have experiences in teamwork. When you cooperated with
your teammates, did you encounter any difficulities and problems?
B:Well, we did go through some difficulities in the first few weeks. Our team is
composed of people from different cultural backgrounds. And I found it
hard to communicate with some of them bacause of my language abilities.
In order to fully understand my partners' opinions, and make myself understood.
I spent a great deal of time practicing English. We then colaborated very well
with one another.
A:Well, then, why did you leave the position?
B:The job and organization were wonderful, and my employer was happy with my work.
But I recognized there was no opportunity for promotion. I'll always value the experience I
acquired there, though.
