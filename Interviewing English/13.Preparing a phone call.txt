A:Hi, I'm Jeremy, if there is anything I can help with, don't be afraid to ask.
I know that everyone is a little nervous on the first day at a new job.
B:Oh, I have so many questions. Could I ask you a few questions?
A:Sure, what would you like to know?
B:First of all, I don't know what I should say when I have to answer
the telephone.
A:When answering the telephone, it's important to make a good impression.
That's why you not only have to know what to say but you also must know how to say it.
B:Oh, I see. 
A:It could be an important client or a potential new customer. Therefore, you
must speak clearly and be aware of your tone of your voice before speaking.
B:And, what should I say
A:Greet the caller by say 'Good morning' or 'Good afternoon'. Then identify
our company and yourself, and finally ask the caller how you can help them.
B:OK, how is this? Good morning, Innovative Incorporated, this is Andrea. How
may I help you?
A:Perfect, you should also write down the caller's detail and the reason 
for the call.
B:OK, I'll make sure there's a notepad and a pencil next to my telephone
