Mean what you say

Some people say that promises are made to be broken
That certainly seems to be true in this cut-throat(competitive) society (that) we live in.
But if you break you promise, you will ruin your reputation, and no one will trust you anymore
So whenever we say, "I give you my word". We should mean it
There is nothing (which is ) worse than to be let down by others, because they have never kept
their promises.
In fact(as a matter of fact), it isn't so difficult to keep promise
Just remember never to promise anything that we are not sure we can live up to
In short, therefore, to be trustworthy we should always say what we mean and mean what we say
