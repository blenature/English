Lily is talking to her singer friend, Chad.
Lily is a girl's name, Chad is a boy's name.
Lily says, "Chad, What a lucky(fortunate) guy you are."
And he asks, "What do you mean( by saying that I am a lucky guy)?"
She says, "Well, you've got everything a person could ask for: a lovely family, fame and money"
He says, "Nothing's as wonderful as it seems(looks)"
She doesn't understand and says, "But such a successful man as you must surely be happy"
But he says, "Not really, I am so busy that I don't live a normal life"
She says,"Anyway, I wouldn't mind being in your shoes(situation)"
Chad says, "And I would love to be able to live as simple a life as you do"
Lily understands now, "I guess you should never judge a book be its cover"
Chad agrees, "How right you are"
