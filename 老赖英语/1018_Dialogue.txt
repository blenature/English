Saving the world

A student is talking to her teacher.
"I hear that scientists are planing to study asteroids and meteorites, is that right?"
The teacher says, "Yes, they want to determine whether Earth is in danger of being striked by such a rock"
"What if they discover that a big one is coming straight for us?"
"In that case, there are two things they can do. They can launch rockets to push the rock off its "
"So that they will miss Earth, right?"
"Right. And if that fails, we can try destroying the rock with nuclear missiles"
"Wow, I never thought that nuclear weapons can save the world instead of ending it"
