Larry said, "What has he done this time?"("What trouble has he caused?")
Hattie said, "Well, he made a date with me to see a movie last night, but he stood me up"
Larry said, "What a lousy guy"
I bought a jacket yesterday, but it is lousy, it tore the first I wore it
Hattie said, "I know, and nothing worse than to be in love with such a guy"
There is nothing better than to work with Bruce
Larry said, "Why don't you dump him?"
Dump garbage
Hattie said, "I can't, I promised that I'd never leave him"

date and appointment
They are very different. If you want to date your girlfriend, or if you want to go out
with your classmate or your colleagues at work, then you make a date.
"Let's go see a movie after work". "Would you like to go to a restaurant with me this weekend, Honey"

If you make an appointment, this is a kind of business, this is more serious.
"I made an appointment to see my teacher after school"
"I don't feel well, maybe I should make an appointment with my doctor"
"Ouch, my tooth hurts, I'd better make an appointment with my dentist"
