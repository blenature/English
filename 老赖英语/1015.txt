Mean what you say
A piece of cake
You should mean what you say
Some people say that promises are made to be broken
Some people say that we make promises to be broken
Make promise, keep promise, break promise
You should keep your promise
Don't break your promise
That certainly seems to be true in this cut-throat(competitive) society (that) we live in.
To compete with others
I can't compete with Bruce when he comes to eating
But if you break you promise, you will ruin your reputation, and no one will trust you anymore
spoil or destroy something
If we are cooking, and we add too much salt, we will spoil(ruin) the dish.
The war ruined the country.
He doesn't live here anymore
So whenever we say, "I give you my word". We should mean it
Don't go back on your word
I mean it
I really mean it
There is nothing (which is ) worse than to be let down by others, because they have never kept
their promises.
In fact(as a matter of fact), it isn't so difficult to keep promise
Just remember never to promise anything that we are not sure we can live up to
He lived up to his father's expectations
To live up to one's expectations
I lived up to my father's expectations, I stayed out of jail
In short, therefore, to be trustworthy we should always say what we mean and mean what we say
