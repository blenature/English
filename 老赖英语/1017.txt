Earth (is) in danger
That little girl is in danger, you'd better go to her side
Seeing is believing(to see is to believe)
(My friend tells me that his girlfriend is the most beautiful girl in the world. I tell him,
show me, seeing is believing)
Seeing a huge rock have a half size of Earth smash into Jupiter in July 1996 is incredible
What on earth are you doing?
Who on earth are you?
How on earth(in the world) do you do that?
Can you image what would happen if Earth collided with a huge space rock
A bus collided with a car and killed two people
A bus collided with a car, killing two people
It would disastrous
When the typhoon hit the island, it caused many disasters
The show last night was a disaster(lousy)
In fact, it is thought that a meteor killed the dinosaur million years ago
A rock like the one that hit Jupiter coule splite Earth into two(pieces)(parts)
Doing nothing about that is like waiting the ending of the world
To do nothing about that ...
We should do something about our traffic problems
I can do nothing about his temper
So scientists plan to start a project to identify all space rocks that could hit Earth
