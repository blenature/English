Don't be a fish out of the water

Do you sometimes have a hard time understanding what Americans are talking about among themselves?

A hook is a fish hook.
If a fish is on the hook, of course, it is in trouble
If it is off the hook, it's out of danger
Besides, it should at least helps you feel more ... and not like a fish out of water when you speak
to Americans
