Think Before You Speak
(Look Before You Skip)
(They give up halfway)
(If you learn something, you should persist)
(You should persist in learning anything, do not give up halfway)
Sometimes we say things without thinking.(without using our brains)
(Usually, in this situation, we're likely to make some stupid statements)
Very often, a thoughtless remark may hurt other's feelings or cause a misunderstanding 
or embarrassment.
(In many(most) cases = Very often)
(He is thoughtful)
(He is thoughtless)
(Everyone likes Sam, because he is so thoughtful of others)
(He makes a stupid remark)
(He makes a stupid statement)
(That man has no feeling)
(feelings=emotions)
(You hurt my feelings)
(I hope there is no misunderstanding between the two of us)
(His careless remark embarrassed us all)
We must therefore always think before we speak
Once, I told an old friend how beautiful his girlfriend looked when I saw them together at
a movie theater the other day.
(the other day = a couple of days ago)
(The other day, we had quite a storm in the city)
(at a movie theater = at a movie house = at a cinema)
Unfortunately, I made a mistake
(I mistake the boy for my old friend)
(I made an error)
(He made several errors in this article)
(I mistook Mary for Jane)
I happened that she wasn't with my friend, she was with someone else
(It happens that = it turns out that)
(It turned out that he was a bad guy)
I had let the cat out of the bag. so to speak
(If you have a bag and something in it, we can see what's in the bag.
And if you put a cat into a bag, the cat would not be happy, and it will try to get out,
but you can't see what's in the bag. Finally, we won't know what's in the bag until you let
the cat out of the bag)
(I have revealed the secret)
(Don't let the cat out of the bag, just between you and me)
(Bruce is a scholar, so to speak)
I've never been so embarrassed in my life
(When I told the secret to my old friend, my friend definitely would be very shocked)
(That time, I was not at the movie theater, I was somewhere in the kitchen, I was cooking dinner.
and yet my girlfriend was going to see movie with someone else)
I certainly learned my lesson but at a very high price
(I've learned a lesson a hard way)
(Many students who want to be successful, they want to go to college, they study very very hard,
and that's good, but maybe they don't exercise, they don't eat right, so they develop some health
problems. So they can go to college, but they become very unhealthy, so they are successful but
at a very high price)
(He attained his goal but at a very high price)
His girlfriend never spoke to me again, 
and to make matters worse, it is rumored that they eventually broke up
(Don't cheat on me)
(Be faithful to me)
