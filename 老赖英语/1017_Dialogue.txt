Earth in danger

Seeing a huge rock have a half size of Earth smash into Jupiter in July 1996 is incredible
Can you image what would happen if Earth collided with a huge space rock
It would be disastrous
In fact, it is thought that a meteor killed the dinosaur million years ago
A rock like the one that hit Jupiter coule splite Earth into two(pieces)(parts)
Doing nothing about that is like waiting the ending of the world
So scientists plan to start a project to identify all space rocks that could hit Earth
