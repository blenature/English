Don't be a fish out of the water
(That is slang)
(That is a slang expression)
(If I were a fish, I would be happy in the water, I would feel comfortable swimming in the water.
But if you took me out of the water, if I were a fish, I would feel uncomfortable, I wouldn't know
what to do. So if you are in strange situation, and you don't know what to do and you fell 
uncomfortabe, we can say that we feel like a fish out of the water)
Do you sometimes have a hard time understanding what Americans are talking about among themselves?
(I have a hard time writing this loveletter)
(I am having difficulty(trouble) writing this loveletter)
(I am having a problem writing this loveletter)
(I am having fun writing this loveletter)
(I have a good time writing this loveletter)
Do you want to know why?
The answer (to the question) is Americans are crazy about using slang
(Tommy is crazy about his new computer, he spends all his time in front of it)
They tend to overdo it though
(Quite often, they go too far)=overdo
(Old people should not overdo it when exercising)
(Exactly, I was thinking of you)
Otherwise, slanging is fun to use(To use slang is fun)
(To work with him is fun)=(He is fun to work with)
You should  try it. And some slang is easy to understand(To understand some slang is easy)
For example, if someone is off the hook, it means that he's no longer in trouble.
(Billy is in trouble because he broke the window)
A hook is a fish hook.
(The table hooked my shirt and tore it)
If a fish is on the hook, of course, it is in trouble
If it is off the hook, it's out of danger
Besides, it should at least help you feel more ... and not like a fish out of water when you speak
to Americans
