	Some studies show that some food is very good for human health.
It can prevent many diseases and help human being maintain healthy. But
most of the studies just chose animals as implementation objects. Maybe some
food is good for animals. But there are many differences between human and animals. 
Some kind of animal maybe stronger in nature, and others maybe larger or smaller than human.
so we cannot say that it is good for human too.
	If they assume that some food has several special effects, but there 
are no enough evidences to prove that these effects could have a good impact
on human health and prevent some special diseases. We maybe say that some food
could help human cuel disease, but how the effect is? Maybe eating some food 
regularly could reduce the risk of getting a cancer by 20 percent. But it is
just a number. We also have no an exact example to prove that some food are
superpower food.
