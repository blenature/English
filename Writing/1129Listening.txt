The Key Problem of Key Schools
	Schools stronger in financial conditions, teacher staff and academic reputation
are usually designated 'key', and would become stronger with the backing of more official
assistance.
	Nowadays, key schools are the most polular stars. Students of course prefer
key schools, because they can enjoy modern teaching buildings, advanced multimedia
classrooms, outdoor stadiums and even indoor stadiums.
	To parents, key school is the first key to the bright future of their children.
At the beginning of every new semester, there are plenty of parents willing to do whatever
it takes to send their children to a school or a class with 'key' label.
	After absorbing great amount of social resources, key schools could not payback
thousands of elites. Instead, they are becoming a kind of dangerous time bomb.
	When key schools occupy most of government funds, those non-key ones are badly
in need of helping hand from the government, coule only get less attention and less
support, thus become less competitive and less attractive.
	The gap between key schools and non-key schools is becoming so wide that it would seriously
affect the education system of our country entirely. What is worse it that imbalanced education would do
great damage to the social justice and harmony.
	We need some effective measures, or it would be later.
