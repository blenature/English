	Some people believe that going to school early in the morning is good for 
students' study. Other students want to start a day late in the morning. Which 
option do you agree with and why?
	
	There is always a debate going around that whether students should start
study of a day early or late. Different people hold different view on this debate.
	In my mind, I think students should go to school early in the morning.
I mainly have arguments as follows:
	Firstly, fresh air in the morning could make students' brain more clear,
and further more, clear brain makes study more efficient. We generally handle the most
difficult work in the morning.
	Secondly, as we know, besides better school performance, students should
pursuit a strong pysical body. And going to school early could offer students good opportunities
to take more exercise.
	Thirdly, in a Chinese quote, "teenagers are full of animation and spirit, just
like the sun at seven or eight in the morning". So it is good for students to play, to
exchange in the sun.
	Finally, I think a good habit is very important for their future study. Getting up
early, taking exercise regularly not only make today a good day, but also help them
form a good habit which may help them gain their achievements.
	And by contrast, there must be some students like going to school late. I was 
ever a student, and I must get up very early in most of my student life. I know it is
uncomfortable, even miserable, but when I think about that time, I think it made
me stronger, and more self-disciplined. We all know that if you want to get something, 
you must pay for it.
