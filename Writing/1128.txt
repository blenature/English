	Do you agree or disagree: it's better to relax through watching a film or reading a book
than doing physical exercises.
	As we have seen, Urban people are under more pressure than ever before as the 
increasing of the pace of life. So people should choose a better way to relax themselves.
More and more people like going to gym to do physical exercise, 
and others like to watch a film or read a book.there is a boom in movie market. 
So what's the better way?
	In my view, I think watching a file or reading a book is better to relax.	
	In the first place, different people prefer different types of film. They can
choose their favorite film to watch. When you're feeling tired, laughing is good way to 
release pressure, so a Comedy movie is a good choice. If you like science,
a Science Fiction movie can bring you into a exciting atsmosphere.
	In the second place, we usually go to movies with our family or friends. We make 
jokes together, we have dinner together, we share the new information together. Nothing
could be better than company.
 	Last but not least, when we are tired, we just want to think nothing, we would not
like to waster our any energy, we just want to be free. But, as we know, doing exercise is
not a relaxing thing, we may be more tired after exercising.
