Now, I'm woking for a network game company. Our company is working to develop network games.
We have developed and published several games. We have a lot of project teams in our company.
Every team takes respinsibility for developing a certain project. The leader of a certain
team must clearly bu sure about what type of game they want to develop, how to do and what
have done. For a newly graduate college student, developing game may sound very interesting.
And they are eager to get into a company in this industry. But, if it was not for your real
love to this industry, you'll find something boring in this industry, because it is not
as interesting as it looks like
