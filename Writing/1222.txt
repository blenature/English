	Most adults believe that modern children behave worse than those
in the past. What actions parents should take do you think will have positive
effects on children to help them behave better like respecting and treating
others kindly.
1,limit the types of the TV programs and movies they watch
2,spend more time talking with them
3,supervise and monitor children when they are playing with friends

	I think that the better way to help a child behave better is to spend
more time talking with him.
	In my opinoin, we should find out the real reasons while facing
a problem, and then choose the best solution towards the problem.
	So, I will try to find out the real reason firstly, and then
explain why we should spend more time talking with children.
	Internet is becoming more widespread than before, and it's interesting
and full of many exciting things. We see Internet as a study tool and communication
tool, but there is also lots of violent and unhealthy information on it. People,
especially children always be attracted by its fruitful content. Being exposed
to some unhealthy information, they may learn some improper behaviors. But it's
difficult for children to judge whether they should make friends with someone that 
they meet on Internet. So parents should be involved in, they should teach their
children how to tell a person is a good man or a bad man. 
	In the current society, economy is rapidly developing, and inflation is on the rise
too. So people have to work harder to earn more money to support family. Working 
overtime is usual. But the more time a person spend on work, the less he accompanys
his children. Children could learn how to get well with others through parents'
company.
