A:Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit, it's a clever design.
Q:Yes, I'd like to see that. What does it clean exactly?
A:It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades, trays etc, and then sends 
them back into the system.
Q:What does the unit consist of?
A:Well, it's basically two tanks. One for the dirty solvent, and one for the clean solven
a pump and washing unit.
Oh, and this's cooling system and a filter. It's all controlled by a PLC system, that stands 
for Process Logic Control
