Q:How do you choose which company to work with?
A:Well, there're lots of things to consider. Quality and delivery times are as important
as price. We also take consideration technical support and after-sale service.
We look for companies with good track record. We place a few trial orders and if everthing 
goes well, we put them on our approved list. It's important to choose comapnies you feel you
can work closely with.

A woman is talking with a man, they're maybe business companies or friends.
That woman what to know how that man choose the company he work with.
That man says he must not only consider price but also quality and delivery times.
But he doesnot explain why. He also says tenical support and after-sales service
are must be taken into consideration. Because none of products is perfect. Every
product would make mistakes while working.
And then that man describes the method he uses to choose proper companies. He will
place some trial orders to some companies, if everything goes well, he will put these
companies on his approvaled list. And finally, choose the most proper company in that
list. He also says, no matter which company he choose, he must make sure he can work
closely with it, because if there's something wrong, he and his company but solve it or
provide a solution asap.
