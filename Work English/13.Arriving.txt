Q:I'm phoning about the factory visit next friday.
What should I do when I arrive?
A:Parking in the visitors' car park in front of the factory and then
go to the gatehouse.
It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park.
The security people will sign you in and give you a visitors' badge.
My assistant will come down to meet you.
Q:OK, thanks, look forward to seeing you on friday then.
