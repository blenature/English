Q:Hi Sven, can you help me? Could you hold the end of the tape measure please?
A:Of course, where do you want me to stand?
Q:Just there by the door. I need to measure  the length of this workbench, we're going to
replace it. OK, 3 meters 47 centimeters, let's round it up to 3.5 meters
A:I'm glad you're replacing it. We need more space to work on things.
How deep will the new workbench be?
Q:Tell me what size do you want, and I'll order the wood
A:Well, it's about 6.5centimeters at the moment, could we increase it by about a third?
Q:Sure ,so let's see. We need a piece of wood 3.5 meters long by 1 meter wide.
I'll order it right away, and I'll be able to install it night Tuesday
