Q:Hi, Steven, what do you think of the new supplier?
A:We haven't had any problems so far. They offer a 24-hour technical backup service.
We've called them in three times this month. They always arrive within a couple of hours.
Q:That's a good service. Do you have to pay extra for that?
A:No, there's no call-out fee, it's included in the annual service contract

A woman is talking to a man. They may be colleagues. They are considering replacing their
supplier. So That woman asks that man what he thinks of the new supplier.
That man says there're not any problems with current supplier, and current supplier's
after-sale service is not bad, they provide 24-hour technical backup service and react
very quickly. It sounds like that man satisfy with their current supplier.
That woman wonder if they must pay more money for this service. That man tells her
there's no extra fee for this service, because their annual service contract indicates
that there's no call-out fee, so there's no extra cost for this service.

service. If our customers encounter problems, we must help them solve those problems asap.
