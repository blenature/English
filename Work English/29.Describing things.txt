A man is looking for his backage on the station. Maybe he is a tourist or a businessman, just
arrive at the station from his business trip. He must find his travel package at the
service center. But the clerk donot know whether his package has arrived. So she asks him
for the details of his package, such as shape and size. That man says his package is delicate,
sou he hopes it was well-unpacked, if not, it maight be broken. He also says his package is
oblong-shaped(rectangle-shaped), about 50 centimeters and the material is metal. The clerk
says there's a unpacked wooden crate in the corner, maybe that man's package is in there.
Hope that man can find his package asap.
