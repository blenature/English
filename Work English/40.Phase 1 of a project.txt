A:Everyhing is going very well. The first phase of the project was finished
three days ahead of the schedule. We're on target to finish phase 2 by the 
beginning of week forty.
Q:That's good news. What's stage do we at now?
A:Well, we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety
