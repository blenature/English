Q:How's the building work going?
A:I'm afraid we have a slight delay.
Q:What's the problem? We really can't have any delay at this stage.
We're working to a really tight schedule and we're ready over budget.
A:The cement arrived late, but don't worry. I'm confident we can meet the deadling.
The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the cement has set we can get started again.
Q:OK, keep me informed, it must be ready on time.

A schedule inspector is checking progress. She wants to know how's
the building work going.
A man who is project manager says they have a slight delay.
That woman doesn't satisfy with this answer, so she says
they can't have any delay at this stage. That woman says they have
a very tight schedule and they'are already over budget.
It sounds like they not only have a time limitation but also insufficient money.
That man says they have delay because the cement arrived late, but he's confident
they wouldn't miss the deadline. The crew are ready are as soon as the cement has set
they can get started.
