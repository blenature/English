A:Quality is very important to us. We work to very low tolerance levels. We need to have 
guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials, Over the years, we have built 
very good reltions with our suppliers.
Q:Do you have many different suppliers?
A:Yes, there're about 50 names on our approved supplier list, but for raw materials we tend to 
deal with three local companies.

A man is talking with a woman. That man may be a manager of a company.
He says his company just want to make high quality products, they couldn't tolerate
low quality products. So when he says 'Quality is very important to us', he emphasized
the word 'very', so we can see that they eager to guarantee the quality of their products.
He also says their suppliers must provide fresh raw materials, not for a period, must
consistently. And to get consistent raw materials supply, they have built very good 
relationships with their regular suppliers. Their company has lots of approved suppliers,
but raw materials couldn't be transported for a long distance, so they usually choose three local
companies as their suppliers.
