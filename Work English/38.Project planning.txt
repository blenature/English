Q:Who's in charge of this construction project?
A:We've taken a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract.
He oversees the whole project. In fact we're having a project meeting at
3 p.m this afternoon to allocate responsibilities and finalise time schedule.
Why don't you join us?
Q:I can't I'm afraid, I've got another schedule meeting for 2:30 p.m

A woman is talking to a man. That man may be a manager of a project, and
that woman may be a schedule inspector.
That woman asks that man who is in charge of the construction project.
That man says they employed a civil engineer who is on a nine-month temporary contract
to oversee the project.
That man invites that woman to join their meeting at 3p.m this afternoon, they'll allocate
responsibilities and finalise time schedule.
But that woman has to attend another meeting, so she refuses him.
