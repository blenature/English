A:We've got very good workshop facilities here. We do all our servicings and most repairings.
We have sperate areas for welding, grinding and sawing.
Q:Is there anything you don't do in-house?
A:Yes, if we don't have facilities to deal with it here, we send it out for maintenance
Q:Is that more expensive?
A:It depends on the job. It's actually more cost-effective that buying specialist equipments 
that we don't use very often.
