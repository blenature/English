Q:Could you explain the paper-making process to us in very simple terms please.
A:Well, the puip falls from a box onto the first part of paper machine, which 
is basically a wire bed with large holes in it where most of the water is extracted.
Q:So, is it actually paper at this state?
A:Yes, it is. But we need to take out more water. So then it passes through 
a series of rollers where more water is squeezed out. After that, it goes through
the dries, which are at a very high temperature. The paper is then coated and finally
it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller length.
